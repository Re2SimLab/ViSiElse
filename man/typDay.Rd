\title{Simulated time data of the actions performed in a typical day}
\format{A data frame with 100 rows and 15 variables:
\describe{
  \item{id}{Midwife students ID.}
  \item{start_sleep}{Time (in min) when the subject is sleeping. All subjects are set to 0 (0:00 or midnight) as the dataset shows a day from midnight to midnight}
  \item{stop_sleep}{Time (in min) when the subject stops to sleep.}
  \item{wake_up}{Time (in min) when the subject wakes up (same values as stop_sleep).}
  \item{shower}{Time (in min) when the subject takes a shower.}
  \item{breakfast}{Time (in min) when the subject eats breakfast.}
  \item{start_work}{Time (in min) when the subject starts working.}
  \item{start_lunch}{Time (in min) when the subject starts to eat lunch.}
  \item{stop_lunch}{Time (in min) when the subject finishes his lunch.}
  \item{stop_work}{Time (in min) when the subject stops to work.}
  \item{pickup_kids}{Time (in min) when the subject picks up his kids.}
  \item{start_cook}{Time (in min) when the subject starts cooking.}
  \item{stop_cook}{Time (in min) when the subject stops cooking.}
  \item{go_sleep}{Time (in min) when the subject goes to sleep.}

\description{
This dataset shows the actions usually performed during a typical day. 
The simulated dataset of 100 subjects correspond to the timestamps (in min)
of each action of the day, from midnight to midnight. Each value is the time
elapse between the begining of the day (midnight) and the execution of the
action.
