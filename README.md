# ViSiElse

ViSiElse 1.2.2 (R package) is a graphical tool designed to visualize behavioral observations over time.

## Key features 

 * It is based on raw time data usually acquired from video recorded sessions of experimental observations. 
 
 * ViSiElse grants a global overview of a process by combining the visualization of multiple actions timestamps for all participants in a single graph.
 
 * Supplementary features allow users to further inspect their data by adding summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, quantile or statistical test) and/or time constraints to check the accuracy of the realized actions.
